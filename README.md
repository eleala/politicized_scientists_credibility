**Politicized Scientists: Credibility Cost of Political Expression on Twitter**

This repository contains materials for the paper "Politicized Scientists: Credibility Cost of Political Expression on Twitter" by Eleonora Alabrese, Francesco Capozza, and Prashant Garg.

**Overview**

The paper investigates how political expression by scientists on social media affects their perceived credibility and public engagement. Combining large-scale Twitter data from nearly 100,000 U.S. academics with online experiments and surveys, the study quantifies reputational costs, identifies mechanisms behind credibility penalties, and explores scientists' own perceptions.
